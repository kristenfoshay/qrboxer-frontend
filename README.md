## QR Boxer ##

I'm currently designing a RESTful application platform to help users move to a new home. Users print out a QR code that they can stick to their box that will link to the app with a list of the items that are packed in the box scanned. Built using React, Node, Postgres, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and Google QR Code API.
